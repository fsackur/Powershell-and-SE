# Powershell and Principles of Software Engineering

This is the accompanying material to a talk delivered on 10/04/19 to the London Powershell User Group: https://www.meetup.com/PowerShell-London-UK/

A recording of the talk will be made available.

## Précis

The profession of Software Engineering has evolved a body of lore that helps developers to write maintainable code. However, there is very little intersection between the set of people who code mainly in Powershell and people who have been trained in software engineering. There is also very little written about software engineering in Powershell.

This talk cherry-picks from the lore of software engineering to see how it can inform us as we work on more complex Powershell projects.
